/**
 * The default implementation of an HttpService. It combines the [[cc.spray.HttpServiceActor]] with
 * the [[cc.spray.HttpServiceLogic]]. If you'd like to use a custom [[cc.spray.HttpServiceLogic]] you should generate
 * a sub trait of [[cc.spray.HttpServiceLogic]] (e.g. CustomServiceLogic) and create your CustomHttpService with
 * 
 * {{{ case class CustomHttpService(
 *       route: Route,
 *       val customRejectionHandler: PartialFunction[List[Rejection], HttpResponse]
 *     ) extends HttpServiceActor with CustomServiceLogic }}}
 * 
 * In this way you can test your CustomServiceLogic with [[cc.spray.test.SprayTest]] without the need to fire up
 * actual actors.
